Problem: A disease affecting 8 million Americans and one in four people over the age of 65 (Liu, et al., 2017). BPPV, shortened for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, is a condition that causes symptoms like dizziness, loss of balance, nausea, and a perception of your surroundings spinning. Unfortunately treatment is very hard to get as non-specialist physicians will choose to not perform the maneuvers because they believe it will cause further harm to the patient if done incorrectly. The lack of experience and level of difficulty in performing the maneuvers is limiting people with vertigo from receiving treatment that is more accessible. Currently, patients within the United States may need to travel for several hours to reach a vestibular specialist to have the Epley maneuver conducted to relieve their symptoms.

Solution: The Verti-Fix is a device that is capable of addressing key requirements for the Epley maneuver to relieve symptoms of BPPV. (1) The angle the head is tilted during the procedure is essential and Verti-Fix is capable of tracking this accurately using accelorometers. (2) LED are used to warn the performing physician if they get close to exceeding the recommended angles. This prevents general physicians from worsening the symptoms. (3) The device is portable and contains an interactive interface that is easy to use and will allow easy adoption of the technology.

Differentiation: Prior solutions involved the use of images and videos to walk people through the procedure, but the uncertainty that comes with moving the head a certain angle still needed to be addressed. Verti-Fix can provide quantitative data during the process and can provide real time warnings to physicians if they exceed a certain angle. Additionally, images and videos cannot clearly communicate the exact angle the head is tilted for different patients. On the other hand, Verti-Fix can be used with videos to provide a comprehensive solution to this problem.
